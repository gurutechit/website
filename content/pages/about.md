## Ciao, I'm Gianluca!

Hello, I'm Gianluca 'gurutech' Mascolo. I am from Italy and this is my personal blog. I live by the seaside in a city in southern Italy, and I like to swim and prepare cakes.

Besides that, I've been passionate about computers since 1986 when I received my Commodore 64. When PCs came out, I started using DOS (of course), then I fell in love with Linux. I've been a Linux enthusiast since 1998.

Now I've grown up and I'm a DevOps engineer with experience in infrastructure and task automation. I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

## What I Do

- Infrastructure as Code management
- Task automation
- A bit of Python coding
- Some experiments with Arduino

## Skills & Technologies

- Linux
